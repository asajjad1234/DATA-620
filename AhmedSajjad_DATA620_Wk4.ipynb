    "Centrality measures can be used to predict (positive or negative) outcomes for a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this week’s assignment is \n",
    "\n",
    "1) to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  <br>\n",
    "2) As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying your data source, you should create \n",

    "1) a high level plan that describes <br>\n",
    "2) how you would load the data for analysis, and <br>\n",

    "4) from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups."

    "\n",
    "This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin OTC. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin OTC rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research. <br>\n",
